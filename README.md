Hi 👋,
I am a Junior at Mahindra University, majoring in computer science and engineering. 👩‍🎓
I am a tech enthusiast who is inquisitive as well. I strongly opine that empathy clubbed with innovation and technology can transform the world into a better place.💻

Well, currently I am a beginner-level MERN stack developer with the following skills:
Computer Science Fundamentals: DBMS, OOPs, Operating System.
- Good at : C, C++, Data structures and algorithms, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- Decent at : BootStrap, Python.

Apart from coding, one could find me watching Ted Talks, reading murder mysteries, enjoying morning walks, and drooling over coffee☕️.
